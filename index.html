            <p>Analyzing the data is not a good choice for my eyes. It doesnot bring a good pay for myself as well.
                That's
                why I am learning and mastering the Web Development. I will not stop eating the head of <strong>Jhangkar
                    Mahbub Bhai</strong> until I become a <strong>Web Development Hero</strong>.</p>
